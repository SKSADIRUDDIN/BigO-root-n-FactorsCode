The expression st.find(i) == st.end() checks whether the value i is present in the set st. Let's break this down step-by-step:

Explanation of st.find(i) == st.end()
st.find(i):

The find method in a set searches for the element i in the set st.
If i is found in the set, find returns an iterator pointing to the element i.
If i is not found in the set, find returns an iterator pointing to the end of the set (st.end()).
st.end():

st.end() returns an iterator pointing to one past the last element in the set. This iterator represents a position that is not valid within the set and is used to indicate that an element was not found.
Comparison st.find(i) == st.end():

This comparison checks if the iterator returned by st.find(i) is equal to st.end().
If st.find(i) == st.end(), it means that i was not found in the set st.
Use Case in the Provided Code
In the provided code, the expression if (x != '*' && st.find(i) == st.end()) is used to determine if the character at index i should be included in the result string ans. Here's how it works:

x != '*': Ensures that the current character x is not a '*'.
st.find(i) == st.end(): Ensures that the current index i is not in the set st.
Combining Both Conditions
When combined, if (x != '*' && st.find(i) == st.end()) ensures that:

The character is not a '*'.
The index of the character has not been marked for removal (i.e., it is not in the set st).
If both conditions are true, the character is added to the result string ans.
